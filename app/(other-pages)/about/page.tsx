          In the year 2022, in some conversation in Facebook with someone, I was
          challenged that it is not possible to make money in halal way. As
          people usually put their money in bank and get interest. But this is
          really challenge to replace this source of income in halal way. That
          is the trigger point of starting our platform. We communicate with the
          business option who are trying to run their business in halal way. And
          made some commitment and then spread the offer among mass people who
          are willing to invest in halal way and was astonished by observing the
          response. This was the inspiration to start a platform like halal
          investment. Since then the platform is running in facebook .
